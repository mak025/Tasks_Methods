             Enum created which includes the four base elements in a DNA string.
             This is to be used later in the two arrays we must compare with
             one another to find the hamming-distance.

            <summary>
            Two arrays are created. One being the "Original (array1)" which the clone (array2) needs to be compared with.
            By comparing the clone with the Original we will find the hamming-distance.
            </summary>
            <param name="array1">The first DNA sequence eg. the original</param>
            <param name="array2">The clone which is to be compared with the original</param>
            
            <summary>
            Calls the HammingDistance method to calculate the difference between two DNA sequences.
            Stores the result in the 'distance' variable.
            </summary>
            
            <summary>
            Outputs the calculated Hamming Distance to the console, indicating how many positions differ between the two DNA sequences.
